## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install Java 17 or higher
2. Install Maven 3.6+ (optional, for building from source)

### Quick Start

#### Option 1: Run with Maven (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd lost-art-java

# Run the application
mvn clean javafx:run
```

#### Option 2: Build and Run JAR
```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/lost-art-java-1.0.0.jar
```

#### Option 3: IDE Setup
1. Import the Maven project into your IDE
2. Ensure JavaFX is properly configured
3. Run the `com.memorytraining.App` main class

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Launch the application
2. The welcome screen shows your current progress and available exercises
3. Select an exercise type from the main screen
4. Follow the on-screen instructions for each exercise

### Exercise Types Explained

#### Word Memory
- Memorize sequences of words (3-15 words depending on level)
- Type the words back in the correct order
- Focus on creating mental associations between words

#### Number Memory  
- Remember sequences of numbers (3-20 numbers depending on level)
- Numbers range from single digits to 3-digit numbers based on difficulty
- Type the numbers back in exact sequence

#### Color Memory
- Memorize sequences of colors (3-12 colors depending on level)  
- Click the color buttons in the correct order
- Great for visual memory training

#### Spatial Memory
- Remember positions that light up on a grid (3Ã—3 to 6Ã—6 grid)
- Click the positions in the correct sequence
- Excellent for spatial reasoning skills

#### Sequence Memory
- Remember sequences of actions or events
- Repeat the sequence in the correct order
- Builds sequential processing abilities

### Difficulty & Adaptive Training

The application uses an intelligent adaptive system:
- **Level 1-3**: Beginner (shorter sequences, more time)
- **Level 4-6**: Intermediate (medium sequences, moderate time)  
- **Level 7-10**: Advanced (longer sequences, less time)

Performance criteria for level advancement:
- **Level Up**: 90%+ accuracy with fast response times
- **Level Down**: Below 60% accuracy
- **Stay Same**: 60-89% accuracy

### Scoring System

Scores are calculated based on:
- **Accuracy** (most important): Percentage of correct answers
- **Level Bonus**: Higher levels provide more points
- **Time Bonus**: Faster completion times earn bonus points
- **Maximum Score**: 200 points per exercise

## Data Storage

User data is automatically saved to:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.lost-art-memory\`
- **macOS**: `~/.lost-art-memory/`
- **Linux**: `~/.lost-art-memory/`

Data includes:
- User preferences and settings
- Exercise completion history  
- Personal best scores
- Statistical information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### JavaFX Runtime Issues
```
Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing
```
**Solution**: Ensure JavaFX is properly installed and included in module path.

#### Memory Issues
```
OutOfMemoryError during exercise generation
```
**Solution**: Increase JVM heap size with `-Xmx1g` parameter.

#### Data Loading Errors
```
Error loading user data: JSON parsing failed
```
**Solution**: Delete corrupted data file in `~/.lost-art-memory/` directory.

### Performance Tips
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Run on Java 17+ for optimal performance
- Ensure adequate disk space for data storage
